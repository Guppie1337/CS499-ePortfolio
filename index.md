## Introduction

In this portfolio, I will present several projects that were created throughout my college courses. Although given the opportunity to work with items completed for coursework, I've decided to use some personal projects to further demonstrate a "before and after" approach. Not only do I hope to express my thoughts thoroughly, but I hope my transition is worthy enough to inspire others to keep learning!

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

## Projects
### Munchy Bear (Software Engineering/Design)

Munchy Bear is a simple arcade game developed in Unity3D for mobile devices; specifically Android. It was the first project I ever completed on my own (except for my wife's art) to get a better understanding of the development process from concept to publish. When I first went through the process of programming it, I was very new to understanding Object Oriented Programming and had very little concept of abstraction. I ended up putting most of the logic for state transitions in the Update method (Unity game loop lifecycle) and only realized the complexity when more than 2 states existed; Play. Pause, and Game Over. Due to this, I feel the project is great for demonstrating my ability abstract the a state machine and reassign responsibilities.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Guppie1337/CS499-ePortfolio/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
